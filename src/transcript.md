# Transcript of the presentation

## Introduction

Hey! I'm Evgeniy. I want to narrate about the lodash. This is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.

## Slide №1 (History)

The original author of the library is John-David Dalton. The initial release took place in 2012. 
Lodash draws most of its ideas from Underscore.js and now receives maintenance from the original contributors to Underscore.js.

## Slide №3 (Why Lodash?)

Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
Lodash’s modular methods are great for:

* Iterating arrays, objects, & strings;
* Manipulating & testing values;
* Creating composite functions;

## Slide №4 (Lodash and the ES6 standard)

Lodash was especially relevant before the release of the ES6 standard.
For example, some Lodash -> es5/es6 array methods:

* each -> forEach
* map -> map
* reduce -> reduce
* find -> find
* filter -> filter
* contains -> includes
* etc

## Slide №5 (Is it relevant today?)

You ask: why should we use Lodash? After all, there are almost all native JavaScript methods that we can use without Lodash. There are differences, and you will see this when I talk about the possibilities of this library.

## Slide №6 (Possibilities)

So, we pass directly to Lodash itself. It can be broken down into several main areas:

* Utilities - for simplifying common programming tasks such as determining type as well as simplifying math operations;
* Function - simplifying binding, decorating, constraining, throttling, currying, and changing the pointer;
* String - conversion functions for performing basic string operations, such as trimming, converting to uppercase, camel case, etc;
* Array - creating, splitting, combining, modifying, and compressing;
* Collection - iterating, sorting, filtering, splitting, and building;
* Object - accessing, extending, merging, defaults, and transforming;
* Seq - chaining, wrapping, filtering, and testing.
